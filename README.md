# Year 3 Cryptography

This project is divided into 4 tasks. These tasks Verifying Credit Card Numbers, Generating and correcting BCH (10,6) code, Using Brute force to break passwords and Implement rainbow tables to break password.  Working on this assignment will help me consolidate my understanding of the material that is presented in lectures. Also it will improve my general software development and problem solving skills.
